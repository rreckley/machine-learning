 ## Coursera Practical Machine Learning course project

 The use of fitness and activity movement devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit have enabled individuals to collect a large volume of data associated with their daily physical activity. The emergence of fitness devices have enabled an individual to not only track the duration of their physical activity, but how well they performed it. 

  For this project, data collected from from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants in a weight lifting experiment will be evaluated. As part of the experiment, each participant in the study was asked to perform 10 repetitions of the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl correctly and incorrectly[1]. Correct execution of the curl was stored in the variable class with a value of A. Incorrect execution of the curl was stored in the variable class with a value of B, C, or E.
  
  The goal of this project is to use the data collect from this experiment to build a machine learning model that can be used to predict the execution of a bicep curl. This requires an analysis of the data set, selection of a model and then using the provided data set to train the model.
